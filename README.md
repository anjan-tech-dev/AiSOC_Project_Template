Title:
Smart Low-Light Vehicle Detection, Tracking & Classification System
Problem Statement:
Night-time traffic monitoring suffers from glare, shadows, and poor
visibility.
Difficult to differentiate between close-proximity vehicles (e.g., 2 bikes vs. 1
car).
Affects urban traffic management, safety, and enforcement.
Goal:
Develop an AI-based computer vision system that reliably works in low-light
conditions.
